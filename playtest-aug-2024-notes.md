# Louisville Makes Games Playtest night 8/9/24

Howdy!
-My favorite part was watching players cheer and get really excited when they beat the level 1 boss. 
-I got the motivation to polish 3 more small issues with that same level 1 boss.

It's especially helpful for me to be able to put my game in front of the general public and see how they interact with it. My goal for Forgetting is that anyone be able to play it, as long as their up for some difficult puzzles. Playtesting is an opportunity to test hypotheses, will players feel overwhelmed by this puzzle and decide to come back to it later? Or will they bang their head against it until it's solved? When I playtest I get the answers to these questions, as well as the answers to questions I didn't know I needed to ask. Playtesting is a huge part of game development, especially for puzzle games, and events like these are a great way to put your game in front of new people and learn from them.

As a playtester playing other people's games: I enjoyed being able to vent my frustration directly to the developer and ask: "Why are the checkpoints so dang far apart!‚Äù

Sure! My favorite part was getting to see people having fun playing my game, as well as getting to hang out with other developers and see progress on their projects.  For me, I received valuable feedback that I think will help improve overall polish with rough edges that have cropped up after making various small changes over time. Seeing a new player's experience as well as getting different developers' perspectives helps me understand various points of potential player friction that I've become accustomed to.

For sure!

It's hard to pick one single aspect of the event as my favorite, but if I had to choose I think I'd have to say the social element. Just having a chance to come out of solodev hibernation, interact with fellow game makers and players, and see what kinds of new projects are being worked on.

The event was incredibly helpful to me in that it helped me decide to continue development on my current project. I had this idea for a game that popped into my head out of nowhere (as most of my ideas usually do), and so I decided to put together a single-level prototype to showcase the gameplay mechanics and test the capabilities of the engine I want to use. Even though this prototype was incredibly unpolished and lacked any of the story content I had planned, the response that I received was overwhelmingly positive. If others enjoyed the project in this infantile state, then I can only imagine what the response would be to the finished product. This has me motivated to make that finished product a reality.
